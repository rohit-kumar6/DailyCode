# 4.1 Question- Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
### For example: Given [1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18], return [1,6],[8,10],[15,18].

# 4.2 Question- Given a read only array of n integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than n/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.
If so, return the integer. If not, return -1. If there are multiple solutions, return any one.
### For example :Input : [1 2 3 1 1] Output : 1  Explanation :1 occurs 3 times which is more than 5/3 times.

# 4.3 Question- Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.
### For example: Given [1,2,0] return 3, [3,4,-1,1] return 2, [-8, -7, -6] returns 1
Algorithm should run in O(n) time and use constant space.

# 4.4 Question- Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
### For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.
We can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.
