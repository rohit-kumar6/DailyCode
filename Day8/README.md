# 8.1 Question- Smallest Substring of All Characters
## Given an array of unique characters arr and a string str, Implement a function getShortestUniqueSubstring that finds the smallest substring of str containing all the characters in arr. Return "" (empty string) if such a substring doesn’t exist.

### For Example: input:  arr = ['x','y','z'], str = "xyyzyzyx" output: "zyx"
Come up with an asymptotically optimal solution and analyze the time and space complexities.


# 8.2 Question : Classic Cookie Problem
A two-dimensional array (matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only 0s and 1s.
Each 1 represents choco chip, and each 0 represents other part of cookie.
A choco chip consists of any number of 1s that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent).
The number of adjacent 1s forming a line determine its size.
Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all line represented in the input matrix.
