# 8.1 Question- Smallest Substring of All Characters
## Given an array of unique characters arr and a string str, Implement a function getShortestUniqueSubstring that finds the smallest substring of str containing all the characters in arr. Return "" (empty string) if such a substring doesn’t exist.

### For Example: input:  arr = ['x','y','z'], str = "xyyzyzyx" output: "zyx"
Come up with an asymptotically optimal solution and analyze the time and space complexities.
