# 1.1  Question- Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
### For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

# 1.2 Question- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n and for multiples of '3' print "Fizz" instead of the number, for the multiples of '5' print "Buzz", and for the numbers which are divisible by both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
### For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, …
