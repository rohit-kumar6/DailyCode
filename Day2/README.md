# 2.1  Question- Given a string, write a program to return a new string with reversed order of characters.

# 2.2 Question- Given a string, write a program to check string is pallindrome or not.

# 2.3 Question- Given 2 strings, we will find the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.
### The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.
### It measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other.

# 2.4 Question- Given strings, find number of vowels and return the character that appears most frequently.

# 2.5 Question- Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
